    at the bottom of the window click on *Environment Variables...*, under the *System variables* section select the *Path* entry from the list and click *Edit...* <br />
    if you don't see entries finishing in *Python311\Scripts\\* and *Python311\\* you have to add them, so in the console execute the following two commands: <br />
    `cd $env:userprofile\Downloads\pc-remotecontrol-telegrambot` <br />
    `.\path.py |clip` <br />
    return to the environment variables editor and in the window showing the list click on *New*, then press the Ctrl+V keybind to paste your Python path, press the *Enter* key <br />

    <sup>(BotFather should has sent you a message with a t.me link to your bot and a token)</sup> <br />
    press on the token to copy it automatically <br />

**11.** first, if you don't have a Telegram username, you have to create your username through your Telegram profile settings <br />
    press *START* in the chat of your newly created bot <br />
    <sup>(you can access your bot by pressing on the t.me link BotFather has sent you before; after pressing *START*, it should reply to you with: 'this is pc-remotecontrol-telegrambot!...' and 'the keyboard is up')</sup> <br />
    if a list of commands pops up you have to ignor it, there's another step you have to do before you can use those commands <br />
**12.** open again the console in administrator mode and execute the previous command <br />

    <sup>(by doing this, the console will be invisible when executing commands from your Telegram bot)</sup> <br />
    click *start it* again and wait about 5/10 seconds<br />
    now you have to close the console <br />
**14.** search for task scheduler in the search bar and click on *Task Scheduler* to open it <br />
    <sup>(if you can't find it, search for task only instead)</sup> <br />
    in the top left corner click on *Action*, then choose *Create Task...* <br />
    in the *General* tab insert the name of the task, use "bot_restart.ps1" if you want, since it's the name of the script the task will run based on the schedule <br />
    select *Run whether user is logged on or not* and be sure to enable *Do not store password* and *Run with highest privileges* <br />
    go to the *Triggers* tab and click on *New...*, at the top, next to *Begin the task:*, should be already selected *On a schedule* <br />
    select *Daily*, then set the midnight, 00:00:00, of the current day as the date next to *Start:*, so remember that 00:00:00 is refered to the day after <br />
    <sup>(for example, if you're reading this on March 9th, set March 10th as the day and 00:00:00 as the time: the schedule will start at midnight)</sup> <br />
    next to *Recur every:* type *1* as the days count, then select *Repeat task every:* and set it to *5 minutes*, next to *for a duration of:* choose *Indefinitely* <br />
    be sure to disable the *Delay task for up to:* and *Expire:* features <br />
    select *Stop task if it runs longer than:* and set it to *30 minutes*, of course select *Enabled*, then click *OK* to confirm <br />
    re-do these last steps to create another trigger but, instead of *On a schedule*, in the new one you should choose *At startup* <br />
    set the other options equal to those of the previous trigger, except for the *for a duration of:* one, there you have to set *1 day* <br />
    go to the *Actions* tab and click on *New...*, at the top, next to *Action:*, should be already selected *Start a program* <br />
    in *Program/script:* paste *C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe*, in *Add arguments:* paste *C:\Windows\System32\bot\bot_restart.ps1* <br />
    leave the *Start in:* field blank and click *OK* to confirm <br />
    go to the *Conditions* tab and make sure to disable all the features <br />
    go to the *Settings* tab, then select *Allow task to be run on demand* and *Run task as soon as possible after a scheduled start is missed* <br />
    enable *If the task fails, restart every:* and set it to *1 minute*, then set *60* as the times it will attempt to restart <br />
    disable *Stop the task if it runs longer than:* and *If the task is not scheduled to run again, delete it after:* <br />
    enable *If the running task does not end when requested, force it to stop* <br />
    under *If the task is already running, then the following rule applies:* choose *Run a new instance in parallel*, then click *OK* to confirm <br />
    close the Task Scheduler window<br />
**15.** close the File Explorer window if it's still opened<br />
    press the Win+V keybind to open the clipboard, a small window should has appeared but, if you see a *Turn on* button, just close it, otherwise click *Clear all* <br />
    remember to close the web browser when you'll finish reading <br />
â € <br />
Done! You've set up the remote controller successfully. <br />
You can now use the commands in the chat of your Telegram bot to remote control the computer. <br />
Actually the only bug that can cause it to crash is adding *w<span>ww.* when using the */link* command. Maybe a few more bugs haven't come up when testing. <br />
However it should be always restarted automatically every 5 minutes after the midnight of the day you've set it up, so if it crashes just wait a little. <br />
Please note that by executing the `batches\hide.bat` command, shortcuts of those required programs installed at the beginning have been actually hidden <br />
and won't be listed when searching through the Start Menu. To unhide them, open the console in administrator mode and execute the following command: <br />
      `batches\unhide.bat`</sup> <br />
